# Application CustomerApp (Angularjs 1.6 + Webpack + ES6)

### Covered requirements:

* Implement in JavaScript using a framework of choice (we like Angular a lot)
* The app should run in evergreen browsers
* Use RWD (feel free to use bootstrap, foundation, ...)
* Use Git while creating this project and if possible Github
* Use a familiar build process
* Feel free to use Typescript or ES6

### Covered bonus:

* Setup a Node server

>Warning: Make sure you're using the latest version of Node.js and NPM

### Quick start

```bash / Terminal
# clone our repo
$ git clone https://github.com/wawandas/CustomerApp.git CustomerApp

# change directory to your app
$ cd CustomerApp

# install the dependencies with npm
$ npm install

# start the server
$ npm start
```

go to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in your browser.

## Installing

* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies

## Running the app

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app with:
```
npm start
```

It will start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://localhost:1234`.

### Build files

* single run: `npm run build`
* build files and watch: `npm start`
